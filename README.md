# DotVoid Forum

## What is DotVoid?

DotVoid is a forum on which you can chat mostly about software development, but also about anything IT-related: hardware, news, tech, video games, ...

The forum has the particularity of being a community project coming from what was Bukkit.fr. That means that it's the community that is developing the forum and its related applications (such as Discord bots), and **everyone is invited to [contribute](#contributing)**, no matter your skills. Everyone can contribute and do suggestions, whether it be the about the code, the design, the features, etc.

Developing a forum ourselves allows to involve the community, energize it and bring it closer together. Moreover, it allows to have a unique website which fits exactly what we want.
